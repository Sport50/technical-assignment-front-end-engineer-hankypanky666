This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

# Technical assignment front-end engineer
Create a minimal news list to create and view articles. An article consisting of at least (but not limited to) a title, a body, the author's email address and a publication date.

Your task is to:

* Create two API endpoints one to add a new article and one to get articles.
* Create two pages, one that lists the last five articles and one to add new articles.

**Minimal requirements**

The three pillars of front-end development are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We would like to see you know how to use them for the right job.
* Use Next.js and React
* Pay attention to semantics: any HTML might work, but choosing the right tags show you care.
* Show us you know how to create a modern user interface using material UI.

**Timing**

You decide yourself how much time and effort you invest in it, but quality(!) and a reasonable delivery time are always highly appreciated.
Please send us an email (jobs@clubee.com) when you think the assignment is ready for review. Please mention your name, Github username, and a link to what we need to review.
